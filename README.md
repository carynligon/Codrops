## Codrops Project

This webpage was built based off of images at three different screen sizes. The page was created mobile-first. Changing view width should appear to be fluid.

The structure for this project is:
* git repo
  * index.html
  * grid.html
  * styles.css (compiled from styles scss files in styles folder)
  * styles.css.map (compiled from styles scss files in styles folder)
  * README.md
  * styles
    * styles.scss
    * grid.scss
      * (partial - contains styling specific to grid.html)
    * variables.scss (partial)
      * (partial - contains variables and ghost classes)

##### To navigate between the index.html and grid.html pages, use the left (index.html) and right(grid.html) arrow icons.
